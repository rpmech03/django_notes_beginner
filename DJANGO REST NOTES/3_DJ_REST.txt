###VIEWSET:

Mainly use to define views of data, we can construct a viewset by inherit our class to ModelViewSet of viewset module and insert the viewset class. We will define
two parameters 1st one is queryset and 2nd one is serializar_class.

from rest_framework import viewsets
from .empserializer import EmpSerializer
from .models import Emp
class EmpViewSet(viewsets.ModelViewSet):
    queryset=Emp.objects.all()
    serializer_class=EmpSerializer

###ROUTING:

We will use router object of rest framework through which we can define rest api routing,We can create a default router and we can register rutch for viewsets.

###SERIALIZATION:

Django's serialization framework provides a mechanism for “translating” Django models into other formats. 
Usually these other formats will be text-based and used for sending Django data over a wire, but it's possible for a serializer to handle any format 
(text-based or not).

from dataclasses import fields
from rest_framework import serializers
from .models import Emp
class EmpSerializer(serializers.ModelSerializer):
    class Meta:
        model=Emp
        fields=['id','name','email','address','sal']
