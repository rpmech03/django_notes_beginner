##DJANGO MESSAGES :

Django provides a model messages through which we can transfer messages with response.We can import message object from django.contrib module

(from django.contrib import messages)

We can call messages.info or success or error methods to generate messages using django and each method contains 2 argument 1st is request and 2nd one is message.

views.py----

messages.info(request,"language deleted successfully")


##DJANGO USER MODEL :

Django provides a predefined model for user that contains following fields---

id,password,last_login,is_superuser,username,first_name,last_name,email,is_staff,is_active,date_joined

It means django defines all the functionality for the user including sessions,login,logout etc.
One of the major drawback of django is we can deal with only those field which is already define there.

""If we want to add some more field in user model then either we will use inheritance or we will use one to one mapping "".
