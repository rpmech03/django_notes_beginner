##FOLDER STRUCTURE OF APP : 

##migrations : 

migrations folder contains all the migration files for our database.

##Django Database Migrations:

Migration is a way of applying changes that we have made to a model, into the database schema. Django creates a migration file inside the migration folder for 

each model to create the table schema, and each table is mapped to the model of which migration is created.

Django provides the various commands that are used to perform migration related tasks. After creating a model, we can use these commands.

makemigrations : It is used to create a migration file that contains code for the tabled schema of a model.

migrate : It creates table according to the schema defined in the migration file.

sqlmigrate : It is used to show a raw SQL query of the applied migration.

showmigrations : It lists out all the migrations and their status.

##admin.py : 

It is mainly use to register all model classes for admin stuff.

##apps.py : 

It contains all configuration for app.

#***models.py : 

It contains all model classes by which we will create tables by using django ORM.[obj relational mapping]

##tests.py : 

It's mainly use for testing an individual app.

##views.py : 

This file act as a controller for django project by which we will receive all the request from templates and generate all the rersponses to templates.

##PROJECT FLOW FOR DJANGO APPLICATION :

Django will start project execution from urls.py file of project,from urls.py file of project we will call urls of applications.

##first/urls.py =

from django.contrib import admin 
from django.urls import path,include                                   
                                     
url patterns =  [path('admin/', admin.site.urls),                      
                 path('', include('home.urls')),]   

(jb blank url file mile to kis url file ke pas pahuchaoge , app ki url file ke pas,to iske liye hm include() fun ko call krege n usme hm include krege app ie home 

ki url ko n likhege home.urls taki use call kr ske.home h app n uske andar h url file n isse he hm app ki url file ko call krege.

##home/urls.py(create this file inside the app):

from . import views                                 
from django.urls import path
urlpatterns = [ path('', views.home,name="home"),]

(dot mtlb parent directory n parent directory means home yha se import krege views ko n this is module)   

(ab yha urls.py file m path ke andar views ko import krana pdega, views file m hme home or app fun ko call krna hoga n url pr jb wo call ho to uska name display hona 

chahye home.)

Note: manage.py neither inside the project nor app, its found outside of the both.
      project ke urls.py se app ke urls.py ko call krna pdega but urls.py app m hoti nh h so use wha create krna pdega n urls.py file ka nam hm kch b rkh skte h 
      but kch standard follow krna hota h islye hm iska nam urls.py he rkhege.
