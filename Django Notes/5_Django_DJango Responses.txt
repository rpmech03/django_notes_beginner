##3rd step:Django Responses- 
                          
In url we will call function of views that receieve request and generate response.
(URL OF APP, ISME YE CALL KREGA FUN KO JO VIEWS.PY M BNA H N WO FUN REQUEST KO RECEIVE KREGA N RESPONSE RETURN KR DEGA TEMPLATE KO)

In django we will generate two types of responses---

1_HttpResponse :

We will import HttpResponse from django.http model and htttpresponse function contains data either in text or html format.

###NOTE: 

Download extensions like HTML snippets,HTML CSS Support,IntelliSense for css and Django baptise,django roberth,django template,django snippets and auto import,
auto close tag.

2_RESPONSE BY RENDER METHOD : 

We can generate response by using render method according to request but render is a overloaded method in django that contains either two or three arguments .

##RENDER WITH TWO ARGUMENTS: 

When we will pass two argument in render function then first argument always should be a "request" and 2nd argument is a "html page".

##RENDER WITH THREE ARGUMENTS : 

When we will pass three argument in render function then 1st argument always should be a request , 2nd argument always should be html page 

and 3rd argument is a dictionary in which we will pass dynamic data.

If you want to use render method in views then we will enabale DTL[django template language]. If you want to enable DTL and apply settings of DTL then we will perform 

following operations in settings.py file of our project.In settings.py file under templates we will define DIRS, we will define folder for DTL.
