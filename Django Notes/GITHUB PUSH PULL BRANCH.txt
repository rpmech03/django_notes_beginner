how to make branches in github?

1_git branch

you will get *main in green colour 

2_ git branch branch_name

3_ git checkout branch_name

will display this message--Switched to branch 'webscraping'

4_ git branch --to check which branch present in branch after creating branch

  main
* webscraping   (will display this msg)

5_ after that we add all data by following commands--

git add *
git commit -m "add new branch"

On branch webscraping
nothing to commit, working tree clean (will display this msg)

6_

C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git push

#will display this msg---

To push the current branch and set the remote as upstream, use

    git push --set-upstream origin webscraping

remote: Create a pull request for 'webscraping' on GitHub by visiting:
remote:      https://github.com/rpmech03/webscraping_fetch_medicines/pull/new/webscraping
remote:
To github.com:rpmech03/webscraping_fetch_medicines.git
 * [new branch]      webscraping -> webscraping

#finally we get the branch here.

#if i want to add other people in my project so that they can also push their work---

#so we will enter into the settings of github then go to colloborators and add people from there.

#if someone wants to work on any other branch so create another one if it is not there otherwise go with existing branch---

C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git branch webscraping_02

C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git checkout webscraping_02
Switched to branch 'webscraping_02'

#now use any file of the project and push that file ---

###never click compress and pull request block otherwise it will disorganize your branches like exchanged tha data and whenever we do it live then we will remove
that block.

###NOW WE WILL DO PULL IN PROJECT:

FOR THAT CHANGE THE BRANCH---

C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git checkout webscraping
Switched to branch 'webscraping'


C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git merge webscraping_02

C:\dj3.30\webscraping_fetch_medicines>git merge origin webscraping_02
